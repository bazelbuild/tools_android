This repository hosts tools for use with building Android apps with Bazel.

## Setup

To use this with Bazel, add the following snippet to your WORKSPACE file:

```python
TOOLS_ANDROID_VERSION = "0.1" # or the latest version

http_archive(
    name = "tools_android",
    strip_prefix = "tools_android-%s" % TOOLS_ANDROID_VERSION,
    url = "https://github.com/bazelbuild/tools_android/archive/%s.tar.gz" % TOOLS_ANDROID_VERSION,
)

load("@tools_android//tools/googleservices:defs.bzl", "google_services_workspace_dependencies")

google_services_workspace_dependencies()
```

## Google Services XML

For an example of integrating with Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), [see this
